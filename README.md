This is a Pokemon Team Randomizer created by Sammyajit Datta which enables users to generate 3 random pokemon and builds at a time, of which they are
allowed to select one. They can do this upwards of 6 times.
The builds for the pokemon are scraped from Smogon, a competitive pokemon building website, using Puppeteer. 
The background audio is the Pokemon Little Root Town Audio.

To make the program functional, 2 things must be done:
  1. Enter the backend folder and do npm install
  2. Additionally, inside the backend a .env folder must be created where you set a port and create a MongoDB URI. Note, the port number needs to be manually adjusted in pokemon.js.

Tech Stack:
  1. Frontend: Javascript, HTML, CSS
  2. Backend: Node.js/Express, MongoDB, Puppeteer
  3. Other Libraries: Pokemon-showdown, CORS
